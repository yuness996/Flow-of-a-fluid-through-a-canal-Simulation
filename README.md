# Flow-of-a-fluid-through-a-canal-Simulation
The canal is represented by two parallel surfaces with a cylinder in the middle of it. 
The fluid will flow according to Navier Stokes equation. We study how the flow changes with the change of Reynold's number.
Castem21 software done by cea is used to do this simulation.
